<h1>About Me</h1>
<p> Wife to a human, human to two cockatiels, Indo-Brazilian, Psychology student, Helpdesk agent, currently learning web development. </p>

<p> I spend most of my time at home, being a remote worker and remote student. In my free time, I am either working out, cooking, reading/learning or simply watching TV. </p>

<p>My newest obsessions are taking care of my house and plants and learning html!</p>
